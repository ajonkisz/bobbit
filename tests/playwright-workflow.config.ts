/**
 * ⚠️  MANUAL TESTING ONLY — DO NOT use in CI or automated test runs.
 *
 * This config connects to an already-running dev server (started via
 * `npm run dev:harness`). It has NO webServer isolation — it talks to
 * whatever is running on the configured URLs, using the real ~/.pi
 * token and state directory.
 *
 * For automated / CI testing, use playwright-e2e.config.ts instead,
 * which spins up an isolated sandboxed gateway on port 3099 with
 * BOBBIT_PI_DIR set to .e2e-pi/.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   1. Start the dev server:  npm run dev:harness
 *   2. Set env vars if needed:
 *        FRONTEND_URL  (default: https://100.123.227.233:5173)
 *        GATEWAY_URL   (default: https://100.123.227.233:3001)
 *   3. Run:  npx playwright test --config tests/playwright-workflow.config.ts

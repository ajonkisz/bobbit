/**
 * F4/VER-01 default-workflow activation (docs/design/gate-step-cache.md).
 *
 * This template seeds workflows for *arbitrary* managed projects (any
 * language/layout — `Component.commands` are opaque shell strings), so it
 * cannot assume a source-tree convention like this repo's own dogfooded
 * `.bobbit/config/project.yaml` does (`src/**`, `tsconfig*.json`, etc. —
 * see `tests/gate-cache-globs-adoption.test.ts`). Declaring those
 * Bobbit-specific globs here would be UNDER-broad for any other project's
 * layout — a change to that project's real source (e.g. `main.py`,
 * `pkg/foo.go`) would silently miss the glob and let `BOBBIT_GATE_CACHE=content`
 * reuse a stale pass, which the design doc calls out as never acceptable.
 *
 * `["**"]` is the one glob that's sound for every layout: paths reported by
 * `gitListTrackedPaths`/`gitDiffIsClean` (verification-harness.ts) are
 * already scoped to the step's resolved `cwd` (`componentRoot()` —
 * `<repo>/<relativePath>` for that component, collapsing to the whole repo
 * for single-repo/single-component projects). `["**"]` matches every
 * tracked path under that cwd, so a step is only reused when literally
 * nothing in its own component changed — an unconditionally sufficient
 * (maximally conservative, never under-broad) precondition regardless of
 * what language or file layout the component uses. It's a no-op for
 * single-component projects (their cwd is the whole repo, and a Ralph-loop
 * iteration always changes something), but a real win for multi-component
 * projects (`buildAllComponentsWorkflow` / `docs/design/multi-repo-components.md`):
 * a fix scoped to one component no longer busts a sibling component's
 * cached Build/Type check/Unit tests results.

Read the key documentation files: AGENTS.md, README.md, and files in docs/.

The goal spec is:
{{goal_spec}}

**Documentation location rules:**
- Detailed feature behavior, architecture explanations, workflows, and durable reference material should usually live in \`docs/*.md\`.
- \`README.md\` should cover entrypoints, setup, and concise high-level project orientation.
- \`AGENTS.md\` should only change when agent-operational guidance changed: repo navigation, architecture launchpad notes, common task recipes, debugging index entries, verification flow, or other instructions an agent needs in many sessions.
- Do NOT require an \`AGENTS.md\` update for routine product or feature documentation when \`docs/\` or \`README.md\` is the better home.

**Check 1 — Every feature is documented:**
- Every new user-facing feature, API endpoint, config option, or behavioral change introduced in this branch must be documented somewhere.
- If a feature is only described in code comments, that is NOT sufficient — it must appear in a .md file.
- List any undocumented features.
- Also flag documentation placed in the wrong home when that placement creates pressure to grow \`AGENTS.md\` unnecessarily.

**Check 2 — Existing documentation is updated:**
- If the changes modify behavior that is already documented, the documentation must be updated to reflect the new behavior.
- Check for stale references: old API signatures, removed config options, renamed files, changed defaults, altered workflows.
- List any stale documentation that was not updated.

**Check 3 — Documentation placement is appropriate:**
- Prefer \`docs/\` for detailed explanations.
- Prefer \`README.md\` for top-level orientation.
- Only require \`AGENTS.md\` changes for agent-facing operational guidance.
- Flag branches that add routine feature detail to \`AGENTS.md\` instead of the better destination.

**Check 4 — AGENTS.md edit discipline (only if this branch modifies AGENTS.md):**
AGENTS.md is loaded into every agent turn — its size is a direct per-turn token cost on every session. FAIL this check if the diff:
- Adds a Recipe or Debugging entry that spans more than one line. Multi-sentence prose, inlined schemas, code blocks, and step-by-step walkthroughs all belong in \`docs/\`, not AGENTS.md.
- Adds a new entry where extending or replacing an existing entry on the same topic would have worked (net adds drive bloat).
- Adds both a Recipe and a Debugging entry for the same fix (pick one).
- Adds a categorical subsection past ~12 entries without splitting it.
If the diff fixes any of the above (e.g. it shortens long entries, dedupes recipe↔debug pairs, splits a large subsection), say so and PASS.

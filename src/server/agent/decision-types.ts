// SELECT-ONLY decision seam — Wave 0(b) of the Classifier Framework lane
// (EXT-05 core). See the Fable program's classifier-framework design note
// §4/§8/§10 for the full design; this file + LifecycleHub.dispatchDecision()
// implement ONLY the Wave 0(b) slice described there: a typed Decision return,
// a per-(point,kind) allow-list, and outcome tracing. No production code calls
// dispatchDecision yet (ships dark) and no mutate/veto variant exists (Wave-5
// gated — see the Decision union comment below).
//
// This lives in its own leaf module (not inside lifecycle-hub.ts) for the same
// reason lifecycle-hooks.ts does (EXT-02, see that file's header): a future
// pack-level classifier loader/registry (Wave 1(b)) will want these types
// without creating an import cycle back through lifecycle-hub.ts.

 *
 * SELECT-ONLY for Wave 0(b): no `mutate` (rewrite-and-continue) or `veto`
 * (deny/terminal) variant exists yet. Those are Wave-5-gated (design doc §6
 * RW mount property + §10 phased plan) — introducing them here before a
 * second composing mutator exists would be exactly the over-engineering the
 * design doc's §10/§2 explicitly warns against. If you're adding one: read
 * the design doc's safety model (§6) first — mutate/veto need re-validation,
 * trust-tier checks, and a fail-closed default that `select`/`abstain` don't.
